          <h3>Back to the Roots</h3>
          <p>
            Frozen Throne has a purpose to bring Wrath of the Lich King back to life. It is where many of us began our journey through World of Warcraft, and it is where many of us finished it. It was an experience that shaped some of our lives, introduced us to epic stories, and allowed us to meet wonderful people that are still our friends to this day.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Through our passion, love and devotion to the game, its story and characters, we will make it possible to return to Azeroth, go beyond the Dark Portal, and return to the frozen wastes of Northrend, where the Lich King sits on the Frozen Throne, at the top of the world.

          <h3>Timeless Experience</h3>
          <p>
            All details matter. This is why we are spending countless hours researching and mastering the world we recreate. We aim to bring the original Wrath of the Lich King back in its entirety, from Northshire Abbey, through Hellfire Peninsula, and, at last, to the frozen heart of Icecrown.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The spirit of the game is kept and its faithfulness will bring you back to a time when you stepped onto the frozen shores of Northrend for the first time. The legacy of Arthas, the Lich King, shall endure.
